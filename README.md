# coffeescript-datetime
JQuery datetime plugin from built in CoffeeScript. Built my own as other date and time selectors didn't have the exact nuance I was looking for when it came to selecting time and timezone.

I built this for another project, so it uses Teacup for templating, but this could easily be swapped out. Check comments for relevant template locations. Stylus file for styling is provided as well.

Hope it's useful to others. Feedback welcome.
